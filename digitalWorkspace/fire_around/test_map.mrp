Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  11 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
   7 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "XLXI_3/XLXI_69" (BUF) removed.
Loadless block "XLXI_3/XLXI_70" (BUF) removed.
 The signal "XLXI_3/XLXN_217" is loadless and has been removed.
  Loadless block "XLXI_3/XLXI_137/q_tmp" (FF) removed.
   The signal "XLXI_3/XLXI_137/q_tmp_q_tmp_MUX_8_o" is loadless and has been
removed.

The trimmed logic reported below is either:
   1. part of a cycle
   2. part of disabled logic
   3. a side-effect of other trimmed logic

The signal "XLXI_4/enable" is unused and has been removed.
 Unused block "XLXI_4/enable" (LATCH) removed.
